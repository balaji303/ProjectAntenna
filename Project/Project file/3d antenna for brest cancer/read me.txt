1.Open the SIGVIEW software.
2.Go to Data discription and open data discription.
3.Record the signal through the antenna connected to the system in various region of breast phantom.
4.Save the recordings as wave files.
5.Open the MATLAB Software and explore the demo program.
6.Run the program with inputs as the two wave files.
7.Save the output waveform graph.
8.After saving the outputs,explore the diagnosis program and Run it .
9.Give the inputs as the wave files.
10.After executing the program the output graph for the comparison of the signals will be displayed,verify the outputs.
